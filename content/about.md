# About
 
Hi, I’m Andrea 👋

I’m a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Trento, and right now I’m spending a semester abroad at NTNU in Norway (Aug–Dec 2025).  
My path started with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, where I got solid skills in programming, data analysis, and software engineering. Now I’m diving deeper into machine learning and AI systems, trying to turn theory into something useful.

I’m especially interested in language modeling, vision–language models, and optimization — basically how we can make AI smarter, more efficient, and actually understandable. What excites me is when research meets real-world problems, and you can see the impact of your work outside of papers.

Outside uni, I love to travel and experience new cultures (Erasmus was a natural choice for me ✈️). Sports are also a big part of my life, especially volleyball. Fun fact: one of my AI projects was actually about sports analytics.

This site is just my way of sharing my journey, the projects I’ve worked on, and a bit of what drives me forward.
